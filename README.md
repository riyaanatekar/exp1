AIM : 
To study the basics of Python programming and understand fundamental concepts such as variable declaration, multiple assignment, input/output operations, and conditional statements.

THEORY :
  Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows programmers to write clear and concise code using easy-to-understand syntax.
   In this experiment, basic Python concepts are introduced:
   Variable Assignment: Python allows assigning values to variables directly without specifying data types.
   Multiple Assignment: Multiple variables can be assigned values in a single line.
   Print Function: The print() function is used to display output on the screen.
   Input Function: The input() function is used to take user input during runtime.
   Conditional Statements: if-else statements are used to make decisions based on conditions, such as comparing two numbers and determining the greater value.

ALGORITHMS:
Algorithm 1: Assigning and Printing Multiple Variables
1)Start
2)Assign values "orange", "apple", "banana" to variables x, y, z
3)Print the value of x
4)Stop

Algorithm 2: Area of Circle Using math.pi
1)Start
2)Import math module
3)Read radius r as float
4)Calculate area using area = π × r²
5)Display the area
6)stop

Algorithm 3: Finding the Greater of Two Numbers
1)Start
2)Read integer input a
3)Read integer input b
4)If a > b, print "a is greater"
5)Else, print "b is greater"
6)Stop
   
   CONCLUSION : 
  The experiment was successfully executed and the basic concepts of Python programming were understood. Variable assignment, input/output operations, and conditional statements were implemented correctly.
  This experiment helps build a strong foundation in Python, which is useful for advanced programming and problem-solving tasks.
