AIM : 
To study the basics of Python programming and understand fundamental concepts such as variable declaration, multiple assignment, input/output operations, and conditional statements.


THEORY :
  Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It allows programmers to write clear and concise code using easy-to-understand syntax.

  In this experiment, basic Python concepts are introduced:

  Variable Assignment: Python allows assigning values to variables directly without specifying data types.

  Multiple Assignment: Multiple variables can be assigned values in a single line.

  Print Function: The print() function is used to display output on the screen.

  Input Function: The input() function is used to take user input during runtime.

  Conditional Statements: if-else statements are used to make decisions based on conditions, such as comparing two numbers and determining the greater value.


CONCLUSION : 
  The experiment was successfully executed and the basic concepts of Python programming were understood. Variable assignment, input/output operations, and conditional statements were implemented correctly.
  This experiment helps build a strong foundation in Python, which is useful for advanced programming and problem-solving tasks.
